## Moves

Choose four Moves.

- **Bat Bending:** When presented with a group of bats, Roll+WIS to bend them to your will.
  - 10+ : The bats will do exactly as you wish until you break concentration.
  - 7-9 : The bats will do as you wish, but are not to be trifled with. Choose one:
    - The bats only follow one order and then disperse.
    - The bats follow orders while you concentrate, but turn on you afterwards.

* **Chiroptera Conjuration:** Wiggle your fingers and Roll+WIS to bring forth bats from the void.

  - 10+ : As many bats as you want spew forth. You may take one immediate action with them.
  - 7-9 : A modest group of bats swoop into the area. They are still wild bats.
  - <7 : A single bat arrives, but please don't be too disappointed. He's trying his best.

* **Bat!:** You may assume the form of a bat at will, as long as you are able to shout "Bat!". You can turn back into a human as you wish.

* **Council of Shadows:** Whisper a message for the council to one of your bat friends. Roll+CHA to request some form of aid from the cabal in which you learned your craft.

  - 10+ : Your request is granted. An ally appears or the bat returns carrying aid of your choosing.
  - 7-9 : The bat returns with a message for you. The help will be provided, but at a cost. The Council is so stingy.

* **Echolocation:** You do not need light to see, as you can deduce your surroundings by screeching obnoxiously.
