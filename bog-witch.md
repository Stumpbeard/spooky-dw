## Moves

**Mossy Cantrips** and **First Level Spells** are mandatory. Choose two other Moves.

- **Mossy Cantrips**: You may cast any of your cantrips as often as you like.
  - _Smells:_ Summon Any smell you can think of in the visible area.
  - _Control Flora:_ Any plantlife in your eyesight can be commanded to do as you wish besides cause damage. If you break line of sight with the plant, it goes back to its boring prior life.
  - _Prestidigitation...?:_ You know what Prestidigitation does. This does all of that, but only if it's kind of gross.

* **First Level Spells**: Roll+INT to cast any of these. On 7-9, you cannot cast any of them again until you've rested for an hour. On <7 the spell backfires.

  - _Bog Blast:_ Deal 2d4 damage to one target.

  * _Blend In:_ Shroud the area in boggish plant life. You fit in well enough to be effectively hidden.
  * _Summon Swamp Creature:_ Summon any swamp-dwelling animal to your aid. They follow any orders you give them.
  * _Ring of Fungus:_ Bring forth a circle of mushrooms from the ground, fitting one person to start and growing to fit a number of additional people equal to the number of minutes you concentrate on it. When concentration ends, teleport to anywhere with nature.

* **Marsh Breath:** When attempting to Parley or Defy Danger via intimidation, if you are in close proximity, roll 1d6+1d8+WIS instead.

* **Super Boggin':** On a roll of 10+ when casting a First Level Spell, you may choose to expend your cast as if it were a roll of 7-9 but strongly amplify or double it in a way of your choosing.

* **Worm Whisperer**: The worms know everything. If you have a chance to converse with a worm, snail, or slug before making a Spout Lore or Discern Realities Move, roll 2d8 instead of 2d6.
