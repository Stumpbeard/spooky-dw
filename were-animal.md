## Moves

**Shapeshifter** is mandatory. Choose three additional Moves.

- **Shapeshifter:** On character creation, choose an animal that gave you your gift. At will, you can roll+STR to turn into a buffer version of that animal with a special ability (determined in collaboration with GM) and receive an amount of Hold to spend on that ability, turning back when it is expended. You may at any time expend all Hold to turn back.

  - 10+ : Hold 3.
  - 7-9 : Hold 2.
  - <7 : Hold 1 and lose control.

- **Preferred Prey:** Choose two types of foe. When rolling violently against them, roll 1d6+1d8 instead of 2d6. In addition, deal an additional damage.

- **Bloodrage:** Instead of taking damage, you may opt to take -1 ongoing on all rolls until you have eaten a foe. You may stack this up to 3 times.

- **Howl at the Moon:** At the start of combat you initiate, you may roll+CHA to empower your friends and frighten your enemies.

  - 10+ : All enemies cower away from you. All friends take +1 on their next roll.
  - 7-9 : Choose one or the other.

- **Relatable dude:** You can talk to all animals! Warning: they don't necessarily have to like you.
