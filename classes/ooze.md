- **The Good Sludge:** Offer a piece of yourself to a comrade. Take 2 damage, heal them for 1d6+2.

- **The Bad Sludge**: Pry off a piece of yourself to use as poison for any purpose you wish. Throwing? Putting on a weapon? Your call. Take 2 damage, poison adds 1d4 damage via any application method.

- **Regenerator**: Outside of dangerous situations, rapidly rejuvenate. Roll+CON after every combat encounter.

  - 10+ : Fully restore all HP.
  - 7-9 : Restore 1d6 HP.

- **David and Goliath:** You may make yourself very big or very small. Roll+WIS any time you attempt this, stating which size you'd like to become.

  - 10+ : Choose whether you become big or small. Big Oozes are good for intimidation and step ladders. Small Oozez are good for sneaking and cuddling.
  - 7-9 : Choose whether you become big or small, but it only lasts until your next action.
  - <7 : You become the opposite intended size! Make the most of it!

- **Jelly of Holding:** Anything that isn't resisting can be encased and carried inside you at no penalty. You may encase any number of things like this. Once it is fully inside of you, there is no escape without your permission.
