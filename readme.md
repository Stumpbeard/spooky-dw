# Dungeon World Spooky One Shot Homebrew Classes

Hey folks so these are the classes I put together for our spooky one shot. Browse them at your leisure.

## Character creation

1. Notice that all of the classes start with "The" - there is no overlap. There cannot be two Bog Witches. You are _The_ Bog Witch. Figure it out.

2. Choose a creature of the night as your class. Follow the instructions for how many Moves (a sort of combination of Feats and active skills) you should choose, and which are mandatory. You should end up with four.

3. I have given a couple examples of Bonds. Use these ones or come up with your own, they're only meant to be inspiration. Fill in another player's character in the blank. Try to have at least 2. There will be some sort of mechanical benefit to acting within a Bond.

4. The abilities are same as D&D: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma. Use a point array to assign values to each, I've given suggestions for most helpful abilities per class. The array (with roll bonuses in parentheses) is `16 (+2), 15 (+1), 13 (+1), 12 (-), 9 (-), 8 (-1)`.

5. You can clone this repo and use my docs for your character sheets if you'd like or just copy info over to a note doc or something. Write it out in pencil if you're a baller.

## How play works

Unlike D&D which has a very separate "combat mode" and "not combat mode", there really isn't a differentiator in Dungeon World. The game works in turns between a Player and the GM. The GM presents a situation that requires a response, usually towards a particular player, and that player says how they respond and what they want the outcome to be. The GM and Player decide which basic "Move" that described response falls into, and the player will roll 2d6 + an ability modifier.

On a 10+, whatever the player hoped to achieve comes to pass! On a 7-9, the player maybe gets half of what they want, or they get what they want at a cost, or they have to choose between not-quite-what they wanted outcomes. You get the gist. On a 6 or lower, they don't get what they want, and the situation becomes more dire! The important thing is that all of these outcomes will set us up for the GM to respond with furthered action! By explicit design, there is no roll that simply results in "nothing happens", and the GM never rolls dice.

There is no initiative, as the GM chooses who to point the action towards as is appropriate for the fiction of the scene. Mechanically, combat is nothing special - you're just more likely to be rolling with a STR or DEX modifier than CHA!

While the class you choose will have special Moves that are unique to your character, you shouldn't think about anything else in terms of "what can I mechanically do". The spirit of the game is to describe anything you want your _character_ to do, and we'll figure out where it fits in the rules!
